# Rogue Light
*A game focusing on game engine building with C++ and SDL by Jack Hunt.*  

## The Game
The player fires bullets horizontally and vertically to defeat the zombie horde.

### The Player
* Moves around with WASD.
* Fires bullets with the arrow keys.

### The Engine
* Uses SDL to render images and to set up the game window.
* Contains a robust game loop.
* I implemented the appropriate update and render methods for each entity.
* Created a tile map for the backdrop.
* Made a hitbox system.

## Current State of Project
The project has been finished and I have moved on to another. I copied the repository here to be public for use in my portfolio.

## Screen Shot
